<p id="p82" class="p82 sb"><span id="pos45858"></span><span id="chapter13"></span><span id="chapter13_verse1"></span><span class="w_ch"><strong>13 </strong></span>Saul was . . .<span id="footnotesource67"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote67">*</a> years old when he became king, and for two years he reigned over Israel. <span id="chapter13_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Saul chose 3,000 men out of Israel; 2,000 of these were with Saul at Mich′mash and in the mountainous region of Beth′el and 1,000 were with Jon′a·than at Gib′e·ah of Benjamin. He sent the rest of the people away, each one to his tent. <span id="chapter13_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Then Jon′a·than struck down the garrison of the Phi·lis′tines that was in Ge′ba, and the Phi·lis′tines heard about it. And Saul had the horn blown throughout all the land, saying: “Let the Hebrews hear!” <span id="chapter13_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>All Israel heard the news: “Saul has struck down a garrison of the Phi·lis′tines, and now Israel has become a stench among the Phi·lis′tines.” So the people were summoned to follow Saul at Gil′gal.</p>
<p id="p83" class="p83 sb"><span id="pos46608"></span><span id="chapter13_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>The Phi·lis′tines also gathered together to fight against Israel, with 30,000 war chariots and 6,000 horsemen and troops as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore; and they went up and camped in Mich′mash to the east of Beth-a′ven. <span id="chapter13_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>And the men of Israel saw that they were in trouble, because they were hard-pressed; so the people hid in the caves, the hollows, <span id="page413"></span>the crags, the cellars,<span id="footnotesource68"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote68">*</a> and the cisterns. <span id="chapter13_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Some of the Hebrews even crossed the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gil′e·ad. But Saul was still in Gil′gal, and all the people following him were trembling. <span id="chapter13_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>He continued waiting for seven days until the designated<span id="footnotesource69"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote69">*</a> time that Samuel had set, but Samuel did not come to Gil′gal, and the people were scattering from him. <span id="chapter13_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Finally Saul said: “Bring to me the burnt sacrifice and the communion sacrifices.” And he offered up the burnt sacrifice.</p>
<p id="p84" class="p84 sb"><span id="pos47485"></span><span id="chapter13_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>But as soon as he had finished offering up the burnt sacrifice, Samuel arrived. So Saul went out to meet him and bless him. <span id="chapter13_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Then Samuel said: “What have you done?” Saul replied: “I saw that the people were deserting me, and you did not come within the designated time, and the Phi·lis′tines were gathering together at Mich′mash. <span id="chapter13_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>So I said to myself, ‘Now the Phi·lis′tines will come down against me at Gil′gal, and I have not sought the favor<span id="footnotesource70"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote70">*</a> of Jehovah.’ So I felt obligated to offer up the burnt sacrifice.”</p>
<p id="p85" class="p85 sb"><span id="chapter13_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>At this Samuel said to Saul: “You have acted foolishly. You have not obeyed the commandment that Jehovah your God gave you. If you had, Jehovah would have made your kingdom firm over Israel forever. <span id="chapter13_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>But now your kingdom will not last. Jehovah will find a man agreeable to his heart, and Jehovah will commission him as a leader over his people, because you did not obey what Jehovah commanded you.”</p>
<p id="p86" class="p86 sb"><span id="pos48429"></span><span id="chapter13_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Then Samuel rose and went his way up from Gil′gal to Gib′e·ah of Benjamin, and Saul took the count of the people; those still with him were about 600 men. <span id="chapter13_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>Saul, his son Jon′a·than, and the people still with them were dwelling in Ge′ba of Benjamin, and the Phi·lis′tines had encamped at Mich′mash. <span id="chapter13_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>And the raiding parties would go out from the camp of the Phi·lis′tines in three bands. One band would turn toward the road to Oph′rah, to the land of Shu′al; <span id="chapter13_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>another band would turn toward the road of Beth-ho′ron; and the third band would turn toward the road leading to the boundary that overlooks the valley of Ze·bo′im, toward the wilderness.</p>
<p id="p87" class="p87 sb"><span id="chapter13_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>Now there was not a metalworker to be found in all the land of Israel, because the Phi·lis′tines had said: “So that the Hebrews may not make a sword or a spear.” <span id="chapter13_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>And all the Israelites had to go down to the Phi·lis′tines to get their plowshares, mattocks, axes, or sickles sharpened. <span id="chapter13_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>The price for sharpening was a pim<span id="footnotesource71"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote71">*</a> for the plowshares, for the mattocks, for the three-toothed instruments, for the axes, and for fixing fast the oxgoad. <span id="chapter13_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>And on the day of battle, not a sword or a spear was found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jon′a·than; only Saul and his son Jon′a·than had weapons.</p>
<p id="p88" class="p88 sb"><span id="chapter13_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>Now a garrison<span id="footnotesource72"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote72">*</a> of the Phi·lis′tines had gone out to the ravine pass of Mich′mash.</p>
