He did not turn away from it. <span id="chapter13_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>So Jehovah’s anger grew hot against Israel, and he gave them into the hand of King Haz′a·el of Syria and into the hand of Ben-ha′dad the son of Haz′a·el all their days.</p>
<p id="p105" class="p105 sb"><span id="chapter13_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>In time Je·ho′a·haz begged for the favor<span id="footnotesource91"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote91">*</a> of Jehovah, and Jehovah listened to him, for he had seen the oppression the king of Syria had inflicted on Israel. <span id="chapter13_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>So Jehovah provided Israel with a savior to free them from Syria’s grip, and the Israelites were able to dwell in their homes as before.<span id="footnotesource92"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote92">*</a> <span id="chapter13_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>(However, they did not depart from the sin of the house of Jer·o·bo′am that he had caused Israel to commit.

<p id="p106" class="p106 sb"><span id="chapter13_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>As for the rest of the history of Je·ho′a·haz, all that he did and his mightiness, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel? <span id="chapter13_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Then Je·ho′a·haz was laid to rest with his forefathers, and they buried him in Sa·mar′i·a; and his son Je·ho′ash became king in his place.</p>
<p id="p107" class="p107 sb"><span id="pos62516"></span><span id="chapter13_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>In the 37th year of King Je·ho′ash of Judah, Je·ho′ash the son of Je·ho′a·haz became king over Israel in Sa·mar′i·a, and he reigned for 16 years. <span id="chapter13_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>He continued to do what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes, not departing from all the sins that Jer·o·bo′am the son of Ne′bat had made Israel commit. He continued<span id="footnotesource95"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote95">*</a> in these sins.</p>
<p id="p108" class="p108 sb"><span id="chapter13_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>As for the rest of the history of Je·ho′ash, all that he did and his mightiness and how he fought against King Am·a·zi′ah of Judah, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel? <span id="chapter13_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Then Je·ho′ash was laid to rest with his forefathers, and Jer·o·bo′am<span id="footnotesource96"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote96">*</a> sat on his throne. And Je·ho′ash was buried in Sa·mar′i·a with the kings of Israel.</p>
<p id="p109" class="p109 sb"><span id="pos63235"></span><span id="chapter13_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Now when E·li′sha became ill with the sickness from which he eventually died, Je·ho′ash the king of Israel came down to him and wept over him, saying: “My father, my father! The chariot of Israel and his horsemen!” <span id="chapter13_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>E·li′sha then said to him: “Take a bow and arrows.” So he took a bow and arrows. <span id="chapter13_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>Then he said to the king of Israel: “Put your hand to the bow.” So he put his hand to it, after which E·li′sha laid his hands on the king’s hands. <span id="chapter13_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Then he said: “Open the window toward the east.” So he opened it. E·li′sha said: “Shoot!” So he shot. He now said: “Jehovah’s arrow of victory,<span id="footnotesource97"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote97">*</a> the arrow of victory over<span id="footnotesource98"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote98">*</a> Syria! You will strike down<span id="footnotesource99"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote99">*</a> Syria at A′phek until you finish it off.”</p>
<p id="p110" class="p110 sb"><span id="chapter13_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>He continued: “Take the arrows,” and he took them. Then he said to the king of Israel: “Strike the ground.” So he struck the ground three times and stopped. <span id="chapter13_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>At that the man of the true God grew indignant at him and said: “You should have struck the ground five or six times! Then you would have struck down Syria until you finished it off, but now you will strike down Syria only three times.”</p>
<p id="p111" class="p111 sb"><span id="pos64356"></span><span id="chapter13_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>After that E·li′sha died and was buried.

When the man touched the bones of E·li′sha, he came to life and stood on his feet.</p>
<p id="p112" class="p112 sb"><span id="pos64724"></span><span id="chapter13_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>Now King Haz′a·el of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Je·ho′a·haz. <span id="chapter13_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>However, Jehovah extended favor and mercy to them and showed his concern for them for the sake of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He did not want to bring them to ruin, and he has not cast them away from his <span id="page545"></span>presence to this day. <span id="chapter13_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>When King Haz′a·el of Syria died, his son Ben-ha′dad became king in his place. <span id="chapter13_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>Je·ho′ash the son of Je·ho′a·haz then took back from Ben-ha′dad the son of Haz′a·el the cities that he had taken in war from Je·ho′a·haz his father.
