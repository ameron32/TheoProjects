His mother’s name was Ma′a·cah the granddaughter of A·bish′a·lom. <span id="chapter15_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>He went on walking in all the sins that his father committed prior to him, and his heart was not complete with<span id="footnotesource176"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote176">*</a> Jehovah his God like the heart of David his forefather. <span id="chapter15_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>However, on account of David, Jehovah his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem by raising up his son after him and keeping Jerusalem in existence. <span id="chapter15_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>For David did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and he did not turn aside from anything that He had commanded him all the days of his life, except in the matter of U·ri′ah the Hit′tite. <span id="chapter15_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>And there was warfare between Re·ho·bo′am and Jer·o·bo′am all the days of his life.</p>
<p id="p145" class="p145 sb"><span id="chapter15_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>As for the rest of the history of A·bi′jam, all that he did, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah? There was also war between A·bi′jam and Jer·o·bo′am. <span id="chapter15_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Then A·bi′jam was laid to rest with his forefathers, and they buried him in the City of David; and his son A′sa became king in his place.</p>
<p id="p146" class="p146 sb"><span id="pos87630"></span><span id="chapter15_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>In the 20th year of King Jer·o·bo′am of Israel, A′sa began to reign over Judah. <span id="chapter15_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>He reigned in Jerusalem for 41 years. His grandmother’s name was Ma′a·cah the granddaughter of A·bish′a·lom. <span id="chapter15_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>A′sa did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, like David his forefather. <span id="chapter15_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>He expelled the male temple prostitutes from the land and removed all the disgusting idols<span id="footnotesource177"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote177">*</a> that his forefathers had made. <span id="chapter15_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>He even removed Ma′a·cah his grandmother from her position as queen mother,<span id="footnotesource178"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote178">*</a> because she had made an obscene idol for the worship of the sacred pole.<span id="footnotesource179"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote179">*</a> A′sa cut down her obscene idol and burned it in the Kid′ron Valley. <span id="chapter15_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>But the high places were not removed. Nevertheless, A′sa’s heart was complete with<span id="footnotesource180"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote180">*</a> Jehovah all his life.<span id="footnotesource181"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote181">*</a> <span id="chapter15_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>And he brought the things that he and his father had made holy into the house of Jehovah—silver, gold, and various utensils.</p>
<p id="p147" class="p147 sb"><span id="chapter15_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>There was constant warfare between A′sa and Ba′a·sha the king of Israel. <span id="chapter15_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>So King Ba′a·sha of Israel came up against Judah and began to build up<span id="footnotesource182"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote182">*</a> Ra′mah to prevent anyone from going out or coming in to<span id="footnotesource183"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote183">*</a> King A′sa of Judah. <span id="chapter15_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>At that A′sa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasuries of the house of Jehovah and the treasuries of the house<span id="footnotesource184"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote184">*</a> of the king and handed them over to his servants. King A′sa then sent them to Ben-ha′dad the son of Tab·rim′mon the son of He′zi·on, the king of Syria, who was dwelling in Damascus, saying: <span id="chapter15_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>“There is a treaty<span id="footnotesource185"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote185">*</a> between me and you and between my father and your father. I am sending you a gift of silver and gold. Come, break your treaty<span id="footnotesource186"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote186">*</a> with King Ba′a·sha of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.” <span id="chapter15_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>Ben-ha′dad <span id="page509"></span>listened to King A′sa and sent the chiefs of his armies against the cities of Israel, and they struck down I′jon, Dan, A′bel-beth-ma′a·cah, all Chin′ne·reth, and all the land of Naph′ta·li. <span id="chapter15_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>When Ba′a·sha heard of it, he immediately quit building<span id="footnotesource187"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote187">*</a> Ra′mah and continued dwelling in Tir′zah. <span id="chapter15_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>King A′sa then summoned all Judah—no one was exempt—and they carried off the stones and timbers of Ra′mah that Ba′a·sha had been building with, and with them King A′sa built up<span id="footnotesource188"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote188">*</a> Ge′ba in Benjamin, and Miz′pah.</p>
<p id="p148" class="p148 sb"><span id="chapter15_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>As for all the rest of the history of A′sa, all his mightiness and all that he did and the cities that he built,<span id="footnotesource189"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote189">*</a> is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah? But in his old age he suffered from a disease in his feet. <span id="chapter15_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>Then A′sa was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried with them in the City of David his forefather; and his son Je·hosh′a·phat became king in his place.</p>
<p id="p149" class="p149 sb"><span id="pos90286"></span><span id="chapter15_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>Na′dab the son of Jer·o·bo′am became king over Israel in the second year of King A′sa of Judah, and he reigned over Israel for two years. <span id="chapter15_verse26"></span><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>He kept doing what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah and walked in the way of his father and in his sin that he caused Israel to commit. <span id="chapter15_verse27"></span><strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>Ba′a·sha the son of A·hi′jah of the house of Is′sa·char conspired against him, and Ba′a·sha struck him down at Gib′be·thon, which belonged to the Phi·lis′tines, while Na′dab and all Israel were besieging Gib′be·thon. <span id="chapter15_verse28"></span><strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>So Ba′a·sha put him to death in the third year of King A′sa of Judah and became king in his place. <span id="chapter15_verse29"></span><strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>And as soon as he became king, he struck down all the house of Jer·o·bo′am. He did not let remain anyone breathing who belonged to Jer·o·bo′am; he had them annihilated according to Jehovah’s word that he had spoken through his servant A·hi′jah the Shi′lo·nite. <span id="chapter15_verse30"></span><strong><sup>30 </sup></strong>This was because of the sins that Jer·o·bo′am had committed and had caused Israel to commit and because he had greatly offended Jehovah the God of Israel. <span id="chapter15_verse31"></span><strong><sup>31 </sup></strong>As for the rest of the history of Na′dab, all that he did, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel? <span id="chapter15_verse32"></span><strong><sup>32 </sup></strong>And there was constant warfare between A′sa and King Ba′a·sha of Israel.</p>
<p id="p150" class="p150 sb"><span id="pos91565"></span><span id="chapter15_verse33"></span><strong><sup>33 </sup></strong>In the third year of King A′sa of Judah, Ba′a·sha the son of A·hi′jah became king in Tir′zah over all Israel and reigned for 24 years. <span id="chapter15_verse34"></span><strong><sup>34 </sup></strong>But he kept doing what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah, and he walked in the way of Jer·o·bo′am and in his sin that he caused Israel to commit.</p>
