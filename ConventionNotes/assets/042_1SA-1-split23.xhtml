<p id="p173" class="p173 sb"><span id="pos99548"></span><span id="chapter23"></span><span id="chapter23_verse1"></span><span class="w_ch"><strong>23 </strong></span>In time David was told: “The Phi·lis′tines are fighting against Kei′lah, and they are raiding the threshing floors.” <span id="chapter23_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>So David inquired of Jehovah: “Should I go and strike down these Phi·lis′tines?” Jehovah said to David: “Go, strike down the Phi·lis′tines and rescue Kei′lah.” <span id="chapter23_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>But the men of David said to him: “Look! We are afraid while here in Judah; how much more so if we go to Kei′lah against the battle line of the Phi·lis′tines!” <span id="chapter23_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>So David inquired once again of Jehovah. Jehovah now answered him: “Rise up; go down to Kei′lah because I will give the Phi·lis′tines into your hand.” <span id="chapter23_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>So David went with his men to Kei′lah and fought against the Phi·lis′tines; he carried off their livestock and struck them down with a great slaughter, and David rescued the inhabitants of Kei′lah.</p>
<p id="p174" class="p174 sb"><span id="chapter23_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Now when A·bi′a·thar the son of A·him′e·lech ran away to David at Kei′lah, he had an eph′od with him. <span id="chapter23_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Saul was told: <span id="page430"></span>“David has come to Kei′lah.” Then Saul said: “God has handed him over to me,<span id="footnotesource143"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote143">*</a> for he has trapped himself by entering a city with gates and bars.” <span id="chapter23_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>So Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Kei′lah and besiege David and his men. <span id="chapter23_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>When David learned that Saul was plotting against him, he said to A·bi′a·thar the priest: “Bring the eph′od here.” <span id="chapter23_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Then David said: “O Jehovah the God of Israel, your servant has indeed heard that Saul intends to come to Kei′lah to destroy the city because of me. <span id="chapter23_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Will the leaders<span id="footnotesource144"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote144">*</a> of Kei′lah surrender me into his hand? Will Saul come down as your servant has heard? O Jehovah the God of Israel, please tell your servant.” To this Jehovah said: “He will come down.” <span id="chapter23_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>David asked: “Will the leaders of Kei′lah surrender me and my men into Saul’s hand?” Jehovah replied: “They will surrender you.”</p>
<p id="p175" class="p175 sb"><span id="pos101356"></span><span id="chapter23_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>At once David rose up with his men, about 600 in number, and they left Kei′lah and moved about wherever they could. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Kei′lah, he did not go out after him. <span id="chapter23_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>David stayed in the wilderness in places difficult to approach, in the mountainous region of the wilderness of Ziph. Saul searched for him constantly, but Jehovah did not give him into his hand. <span id="chapter23_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>David was aware that<span id="footnotesource145"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote145">*</a> Saul had gone out to seek his life<span id="footnotesource146"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote146">*</a> while David was in the wilderness of Ziph at Ho′resh.</p>
<p id="p176" class="p176 sb"><span id="pos101886"></span><span id="chapter23_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>Jon′a·than the son of Saul now went out to David at Ho′resh, and he helped him find strength<span id="footnotesource147"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote147">*</a> in Jehovah. <span id="chapter23_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>He said to him: “Do not be afraid, for my father Saul will not find you; you will be king over Israel, and I will become second to you; and my father Saul also knows that.” <span id="chapter23_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Then the two of them made a covenant before Jehovah, and David stayed in Ho′resh, and Jon′a·than went to his home.</p>
<p id="p177" class="p177 sb"><span id="pos102303"></span><span id="chapter23_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>The men of Ziph later went up to Saul at Gib′e·ah and said: “Is not David hiding near us in the places difficult to approach at Ho′resh, on the hill of Hach·i′lah, which is south<span id="footnotesource148"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote148">*</a> of Je·shi′mon?<span id="footnotesource149"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote149">*</a> <span id="chapter23_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>Whenever it pleases you<span id="footnotesource150"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote150">*</a> to come down, O king, come, and we will surrender him into the hand of the king.” <span id="chapter23_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>At this Saul said: “May you be blessed by Jehovah, for you have shown compassion to me. <span id="chapter23_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>Please go and try to find out exactly where he is and who saw him there, for I have been told that he is very cunning. <span id="chapter23_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>Carefully ascertain where all his hiding places are and return to me with the evidence. I will then go with you, and if he is in the land, I will search him out among all the thousands<span id="footnotesource151"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote151">*</a> of Judah.”</p>
<p id="p178" class="p178 sb"><span id="chapter23_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>So they left and went to Ziph ahead of Saul, while David and his men were in the wilderness of Ma′on, in the Ar′a·bah to the south of Je·shi′mon. <span id="chapter23_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>Then Saul came with his men to look for him. When David was told, he at once went down to the crag and stayed in the wilderness of Ma′on. When Saul heard this, he chased after David into the wilderness of Ma′on. <span id="chapter23_verse26"></span><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>As Saul came to one <span id="page431"></span>side of the mountain, David and his men were on the other side of the mountain. David was hurrying to get away from Saul, but Saul and his men were closing in on David and his men to capture them. <span id="chapter23_verse27"></span><strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>But a messenger came to Saul, saying: “Come quickly, for the Phi·lis′tines have made a raid on the land!” <span id="chapter23_verse28"></span><strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>At that Saul stopped chasing after David and went to confront the Phi·lis′tines. That is why that place was named the Crag of the Divisions.</p>
<p id="p179" class="p179 sb"><span id="chapter23_verse29"></span><strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>Then David made his way up from there and stayed in the places difficult to approach at En-ged′i.</p>
