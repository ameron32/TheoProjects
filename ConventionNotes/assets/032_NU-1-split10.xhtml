<p id="p110" class="p110 sb"><span id="chapter10_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>“When you sound a fluctuating trumpet blast, the camps of those to the east should depart. <span id="chapter10_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>When you sound a fluctuating trumpet blast a second time, the camps of those to the south should depart. They should sound the trumpet blasts in this way each time one of them departs.</p>
<p id="p111" class="p111 sb"><span id="chapter10_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>“Now when calling the congregation together, you should blow the trumpets, but not with fluctuating blasts. <span id="chapter10_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Aaron’s sons, the priests, should blow the trumpets, and the use of them will serve as a lasting statute for you throughout your generations.</p>
<p id="p112" class="p112 sb"><span id="chapter10_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>“If you should go to war in your land against an oppressor who is harassing you, you should sound a war call on the trumpets, and you will be remembered by Jehovah your God and be saved from your enemies.</p>
<p id="p113" class="p113 sb"><span id="chapter10_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>“Also, on your joyous occasions—your festivals and at the beginning of your months—you are to sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings and your communion sacrifices; they will serve as a reminder for you before your God.

<p id="p118" class="p118 sb"><span id="chapter10_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>Then the Ko′hath·ites, who carried the sanctuary items, departed. The tabernacle was to be set up by the time they arrived.</p>
<p id="p119" class="p119 sb"><span id="chapter10_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>Then the three-tribe division of the camp of the sons of E′phra·im departed by their companies,<span id="footnotesource70"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote70">*</a> and E·lish′a·ma the son of Am·mi′hud was over its company. <span id="chapter10_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Ma·nas′seh was Ga·ma′li·el the son of Pe·dah′zur. <span id="chapter10_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin was Ab′i·dan the son of Gid·e·o′ni.</p>
<p id="p120" class="p120 sb"><span id="chapter10_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>Then the three-tribe division of the camp of the sons of Dan departed by their companies,<span id="footnotesource71"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote71">*</a> forming the rear guard for all the camps, and A·hi·e′zer the son of Am·mi·shad′dai was over its company. <span id="chapter10_verse26"></span><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Ash′er was Pa′gi·el the son of Och′ran. <span id="chapter10_verse27"></span><strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Naph′ta·li was A·hi′ra the son of E′nan. <span id="chapter10_verse28"></span><strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>This was the order of departure that the Israelites and their companies<span id="footnotesource72"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote72">*</a> followed when they would depart.</p>
<p id="p121" class="p121 sb"><span id="pos55420"></span><span id="chapter10_verse29"></span><strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>Then Moses said to Ho′bab the son of Reu′el<span id="footnotesource73"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote73">*</a> the Mid′i·an·ite, the father-in-law of Moses: “We are setting out for the place about which Jehovah said, ‘I will give it to you.’ Do come with us, and we will treat you well, because Jehovah has promised good things for Israel.” <span id="chapter10_verse30"></span><strong><sup>30 </sup></strong>But he said to him: “I will not go. I will return to my own country and to my relatives.” <span id="chapter10_verse31"></span><strong><sup>31 </sup></strong>At this he said: “Please do not leave us, for you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you can serve as our guide.<span id="footnotesource74"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote74">*</a> <span id="chapter10_verse32"></span><strong><sup>32 </sup></strong>And if you do come with us, whatever goodness Jehovah shows to us, we will surely show to you.”</p>
<p id="p122" class="p122 sb"><span id="chapter10_verse33"></span><strong><sup>33 </sup></strong>So they began marching from the mountain of Jehovah for a journey of three days, and the ark of Jehovah’s covenant traveled before them for the three-day journey to search out a resting-place for them. <span id="chapter10_verse34"></span><strong><sup>34 </sup></strong>And Jehovah’s cloud was over them by day when they set out from the encampment.</p>
<p id="p123" class="p123 sb"><span id="pos56342"></span><span id="chapter10_verse35"></span><strong><sup>35 </sup></strong>Whenever the Ark was moved, Moses would say: “Rise up, O Jehovah, and let your enemies be scattered, and let those who hate you flee from before you.” <span id="chapter10_verse36"></span><strong><sup>36 </sup></strong>And when it would rest, he would say: “Do return, O Jehovah, to the countless<span id="footnotesource75"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote75">*</a> thousands of Israel.”</p>
