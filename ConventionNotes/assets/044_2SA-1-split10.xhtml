<p id="p72" class="p72 sb"><span id="pos34321"></span><span id="chapter10"></span><span id="chapter10_verse1"></span><span class="w_ch"><strong>10 </strong></span>Later the king of the Am′mon·ites died, and his son Ha′nun became king in his place. <span id="chapter10_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>At that David said: “I will show loyal love toward Ha′nun the son of Na′hash as his father showed loyal love toward me.” So David sent his servants to offer him comfort over the loss of his father. But when David’s servants came into the land of the Am′mon·ites, <span id="chapter10_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>the princes of the Am′mon·ites said to Ha′nun their lord: “Do you think that David is honoring your father by sending comforters to you? Is it not to search through the city and to spy it out and to overthrow it that David has sent his servants to you?” <span id="chapter10_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>So Ha′nun took the servants of David and shaved off half their beards and cut their garments in half at their buttocks and sent them away. <span id="chapter10_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>When David was told, he at once sent men to meet them, because the men had been deeply humiliated; and the king told them: “Stay in Jer′i·cho until your beards grow back, and then return.”</p>
<p id="p73" class="p73 sb"><span id="chapter10_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>In time the Am′mon·ites saw that they had become a stench to David, so the Am′mon·ites sent and hired Syrians of Beth-re′hob and Syrians of Zo′bah, 20,000 foot soldiers; and the king of Ma′a·cah, with 1,000 men; and from Ish′tob,<span id="footnotesource53"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote53">*</a> 12,000 men. <span id="chapter10_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>When David heard about it, he sent Jo′ab and the entire army, including his mightiest warriors. <span id="chapter10_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>And the Am′mon·ites went out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance of the city gate while the Syrians of Zo′bah and of Re′hob, along with Ish′tob<span id="footnotesource54"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote54">*</a> and Ma′a·cah, were by themselves in the open field.</p>
<p id="p74" class="p74 sb"><span id="chapter10_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>When Jo′ab saw that the battle charges were coming against him from the front and the rear, he chose some of the best troops in Israel and drew them up in battle formation to meet the Syrians. <span id="chapter10_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>He put the rest of the men under the command<span id="footnotesource55"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote55">*</a> of his brother A·bish′ai, in order to draw them up in battle formation to meet the Am′mon·ites. <span id="chapter10_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Then he said: “If the Syrians become too strong for me, then you must come to my rescue; but if the Am′mon·ites become too strong for you, I will come to your rescue. <span id="chapter10_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>We must be strong and courageous for our people and for the cities of our God, and Jehovah will do what is good in his eyes.”</p>
<p id="p75" class="p75 sb"><span id="chapter10_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Then Jo′ab and his men advanced to meet the Syrians in battle, and they fled from before him. <span id="chapter10_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>When the Am′mon·ites saw that the Syrians had fled, they fled from A·bish′ai and went into the city. After that Jo′ab returned from the Am′mon·ites and came to Jerusalem.</p>
<p id="p76" class="p76 sb"><span id="chapter10_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>When the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they regrouped. <span id="chapter10_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>So Had·ad·e′zer sent for the Syrians in the region of the River,<span id="footnotesource56"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote56">*</a> and then they came to He′lam, with Sho′bach the chief of the army of Had·ad·e′zer leading them.</p>
<p id="p77" class="p77 sb"><span id="chapter10_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>When the report was made to David, he immediately gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan and came to He′lam. The <span id="page454"></span>Syrians then drew up in battle formation to meet David and fought against him. <span id="chapter10_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>But the Syrians fled from Israel; and David killed 700 charioteers and 40,000 horsemen of the Syrians, and he struck down Sho′bach the chief of their army, who died there. <span id="chapter10_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>When all the kings, the servants of Had·ad·e′zer, saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they promptly made peace with Israel and became their subjects; and the Syrians were afraid to help the Am′mon·ites anymore.</p>
