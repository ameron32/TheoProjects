<p id="p44" class="p44 sb"><span id="pos26300"></span><span id="chapter8"></span><span id="chapter8_verse1"></span><span class="w_ch"><strong>8 </strong></span>At the end of 20 years, during which Sol′o·mon built the house of Jehovah and his own house,<span id="footnotesource56"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote56">*</a> <span id="chapter8_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Sol′o·mon rebuilt the cities that Hi′ram had given Sol′o·mon and settled Israelites<span id="footnotesource57"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote57">*</a> there. <span id="chapter8_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Furthermore, Sol′o·mon went to Ha′math-zo′bah and captured it. <span id="chapter8_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Then he built up<span id="footnotesource58"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote58">*</a> Tad′mor in the wilderness and all the storage cities that he had built in Ha′math. <span id="chapter8_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>He also built up Upper Beth-ho′ron and Lower Beth-ho′ron, fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars, <span id="chapter8_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>and Ba′al·ath as well as all of Sol′o·mon’s storage cities, all the chariot cities, the cities for the horsemen, and whatever Sol′o·mon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Leb′a·non, and in all the land of his dominion.</p>
<p id="p45" class="p45 sb"><span id="chapter8_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>As for all the people who were left from the Hit′tites, the Am′or·ites, the Per′iz·zites, the Hi′vites, and the Jeb′u·sites, who were not part of Israel, <span id="chapter8_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>their descendants who were left in the land—those whom the Israelites had not exterminated—were conscripted by Sol′o·mon for forced labor until this day. <span id="chapter8_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>But Sol′o·mon did not make any of the Israelites slaves for his work, for they were his warriors, the chiefs of his adjutants, and the chiefs of his charioteers and horsemen. <span id="chapter8_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>There were 250 chiefs of the deputies of King Sol′o·mon, the foremen over the people.</p>
<p id="p46" class="p46 sb"><span id="chapter8_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Sol′o·mon also brought Phar′aoh’s daughter up from the City of David to the house that he had built for her, for he said: “Although she is my wife, she should not dwell in the house of King David of Israel, for the places to which the Ark of Jehovah has come are holy.”</p>
<p id="p47" class="p47 sb"><span id="pos27877"></span><span id="chapter8_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Then Sol′o·mon offered up burnt sacrifices to Jehovah on the altar of Jehovah that he had built in front of the porch. <span id="chapter8_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>He followed the daily routine and made offerings according to the commandment of Moses for the Sabbaths, the new moons, and the appointed festivals three times in the year—the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Weeks, and the Festival of Booths.<span id="footnotesource59"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote59">*</a> <span id="chapter8_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Further, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their services according to the rule of his father David, and the Levites for their posts of duty, to praise and to minister in the presence of the priests according to the daily routine, and the gatekeepers in their divisions for the different gates, for such was the commandment of David, the man of the true God. <span id="chapter8_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>And they did not deviate from the king’s commandment to the priests and the Levites concerning any matter or concerning the storehouses. <span id="chapter8_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>So Sol′o·mon’s work was all well-organized,<span id="footnotesource60"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote60">*</a> from the day the foundation of the house of Jehovah was laid until it was finished. So the house of Jehovah was completed.</p>
<p id="p48" class="p48 sb"><span id="pos28974"></span><span id="chapter8_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>It was then that Sol′o·mon went to E′zi·on-ge′ber and to E′loth on the seashore in the land of E′dom. <span id="chapter8_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Hi′ram sent him ships and experienced seamen by means of his own servants. They went with Sol′o·mon’s servants to O′phir and took from there 450 talents<span id="footnotesource61"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote61">*</a> of <span id="page616"></span>gold and brought it to King Sol′o·mon.</p>
