<p id="p211" class="p211 sb"><span id="chapter23_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Then David organized<span id="footnotesource141"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote141">*</a> them into divisions according to the sons of Le′vi: Ger′shon, Ko′hath, and Me·rar′i. <span id="chapter23_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Of the Ger′shon·ites were La′dan and Shim′e·i. <span id="chapter23_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>The sons of La′dan were Je·hi′el the headman, Ze′tham, and Joel, three. <span id="chapter23_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>The sons of Shim′e·i were She·lo′moth, Ha′zi·el, and Ha′ran, three.

These four were the sons of Shim′e·i. <span id="chapter23_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Ja′hath was the head and Zi′zah, the second. But since Je′ush and Be·ri′ah did not have many sons, they were counted as one paternal house with one area of responsibility.</p>
<p id="p212" class="p212 sb"><span id="chapter23_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>The sons of Ko′hath were Am′ram, Iz′har, Heb′ron, and Uz′zi·el, four. <span id="pos91246"></span><span id="chapter23_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>The sons of Am′ram were Aaron and Moses.
