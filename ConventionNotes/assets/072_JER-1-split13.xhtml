<p id="p513" class="p513 sb"><span id="pos54382"></span><span id="chapter13"></span><span id="chapter13_verse1"></span><span class="w_ch"><strong>13 </strong></span>This is what Jehovah told me: “Go and buy a linen belt for yourself and put it around your waist, but do not dip it in water.” <span id="chapter13_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>So I bought the belt according to the word of Jehovah and put it around my waist. <span id="chapter13_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>And the word of Jehovah came to me a second time: <span id="chapter13_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>“Take the belt that you bought and are wearing and get up, go to the Eu·phra′tes, and hide it there in a cleft of the crag.” <span id="chapter13_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>So I went and hid it by the Eu·phra′tes, just as Jehovah had commanded me.</p>
<p id="p514" class="p514 sb"><span id="chapter13_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>But many days later Jehovah said to me: “Get up, go to the Eu·phra′tes, and take from there the belt that I commanded you to hide there.” <span id="chapter13_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>So I went to the Eu·phra′tes and dug up the belt and took it from the place where I had hidden it, and <span id="page1054"></span>I saw that the belt had been ruined; it was completely useless.</p>
<p id="p515" class="p515 sb"><span id="chapter13_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Then the word of Jehovah came to me: <span id="chapter13_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>“This is what Jehovah says, ‘In the same way I will destroy the pride of Judah and the immense pride of Jerusalem. <span id="chapter13_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>These evil people who refuse to obey my words, who stubbornly follow their own heart, and who are following other gods, serving and bowing down to them, will become just like this belt that is completely useless.’ <span id="chapter13_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>‘For just as a belt clings to the waist of a man, so I made the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to me,’ declares Jehovah, ‘to become to me a people, a name, a praise, and something beautiful. But they did not obey.’</p>
<p id="p516" class="p516 sb"><span id="pos55815"></span><span id="chapter13_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>“And you must also give this message to them, ‘This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says: “Every large jar should be filled with wine.”’ And they will reply to you, ‘Do we not already know that every large jar should be filled with wine?’ <span id="chapter13_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Then say to them, ‘This is what Jehovah says: “Here I am filling with drunkenness all the inhabitants of this land, the kings sitting on the throne of David, the priests and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. <span id="chapter13_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>And I will smash them against each other, fathers and sons alike,” declares Jehovah. “I will not show compassion or feel any sorrow or have any mercy on them; nothing will stop me from bringing them to ruin.”’</p>

<p class="p519 sl">Before he brings darkness</p>
<p class="p519 sl">And before your feet stumble on the mountains at dusk.</p>
<p id="p520" class="p520 sz">You will hope for the light,</p>
<p class="p520 sz">But he will bring deep shadow;</p>
<p class="p520 sz">He will turn it into thick gloom.</p>
<p id="p521" class="p521 sl"><span id="chapter13_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>And if you refuse to listen,</p>
<p class="p521 sl">I<span id="footnotesource129"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote129">*</a> will weep in secret because of your pride.</p>
<p id="p522" class="p522 sz">I will shed many tears, and my eyes will stream with tears,</p>

<p class="p528 sl">From your close friends whom you cultivated from the start?</p>
<p id="p529" class="p529 sz">Will not birth pains seize you, like those of a woman giving birth?</p>
<p id="p530" class="p530 sl"><span id="chapter13_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>And when you say in your heart, ‘Why have these things befallen me?’</p>
<p id="p531" class="p531 sz">It is because of your great error that your skirts have been stripped off</p>
