But El·e·a′zar and Ith′a·mar continued to serve as priests along with Aaron their father.</p>
<p id="p34" class="p34 sb"><span id="pos10778"></span><span id="chapter3_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Jehovah then said to Moses: <span id="chapter3_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>“Bring the tribe of Le′vi forward, and stand them before Aaron the priest, and they will minister to him. <span id="chapter3_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>They are to fulfill their responsibilities toward him and toward all the assembly before the tent of meeting by carrying out their service in connection with the tabernacle. <span id="chapter3_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>They are to take care of all the utensils of the tent of meeting and to carry out their responsibilities toward the Israelites by taking care of the services related to the tabernacle. <span id="chapter3_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>You are to give the Levites to Aaron and his sons. They are given ones, given to him from the Israelites. <span id="chapter3_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>You should appoint Aaron and his sons, and they are to carry out their priestly duties, and any unauthorized person<span id="footnotesource15"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote15">*</a> who comes near should be put to death.”</p>
<p id="p35" class="p35 sb"><span id="chapter3_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying: <span id="chapter3_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>“As for me, look!

In the day that I struck every firstborn in the land of Egypt, I sanctified to myself every firstborn in Israel from man to beast. They are to become mine. I am Jehovah.”</p>
<p id="p36" class="p36 sb"><span id="chapter3_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Jehovah spoke further to Moses in the wilderness of Si′nai, saying: <span id="chapter3_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>“Register the sons of Le′vi by their paternal houses and by their families. You should register every male from a month old and up.” <span id="chapter3_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>So Moses registered them at the order of Jehovah, just as he had been commanded. <span id="chapter3_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>These were the names of the sons of Le′vi: Ger′shon, Ko′hath, and Me·rar′i.</p>
<p id="p37" class="p37 sb"><span id="chapter3_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Now these were the names of the sons of Ger′shon by their families: Lib′ni and Shim′e·i.</p>
<p id="p38" class="p38 sb"><span id="chapter3_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>The sons of Ko′hath by their families were Am′ram, Iz′har, Heb′ron, and Uz′zi·el.</p>
<p id="p39" class="p39 sb"><span id="chapter3_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>The sons of Me·rar′i by their families were Mah′li and Mu′shi.</p>
<p id="p40" class="p40 sb"><span id="page219"></span>These were the families of the Levites by their paternal houses.</p>
<p id="p41" class="p41 sb"><span id="chapter3_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>From Ger′shon came the family of the Lib′nites and the family of the Shim′e·ites.

These were the families of the Ko′hath·ites. <span id="chapter3_verse28"></span><strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>The number of all the males from a month old and up was 8,600; they were responsible for taking care of the holy place. <span id="chapter3_verse29"></span><strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>The families of the sons of Ko′hath camped on the south side of the tabernacle. <span id="chapter3_verse30"></span><strong><sup>30 </sup></strong>The chieftain of the paternal house of the families of the Ko′hath·ites was E·li·za′phan the son of Uz′zi·el. <span id="chapter3_verse31"></span><strong><sup>31 </sup></strong>Their responsibility was to care for the Ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the utensils used to minister in the holy place, the screen,<span id="footnotesource19"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote19">*</a> and all the service connected with these.</p>
<p id="p43" class="p43 sb"><span id="chapter3_verse32"></span><strong><sup>32 </sup></strong>The head chieftain of the Levites was El·e·a′zar the son of Aaron the priest, who had the oversight of those taking care of the responsibilities of the holy place.</p>
<p id="p44" class="p44 sb"><span id="chapter3_verse33"></span><strong><sup>33 </sup></strong>From Me·rar′i came the family of the Mah′lites and the family of the Mu′shites. These were the families of Me·rar′i. <span id="chapter3_verse34"></span><strong><sup>34 </sup></strong>The number of all the males from a month old and up who were registered was 6,200. <span id="chapter3_verse35"></span><strong><sup>35 </sup></strong>The chieftain of the paternal house of the families of Me·rar′i was Zu′ri·el the son of Ab′i·ha·il. They were encamped on the north side of the tabernacle. <span id="chapter3_verse36"></span><strong><sup>36 </sup></strong>The sons of Me·rar′i were responsible for overseeing the panel frames of the tabernacle, its bars, its pillars, its socket pedestals, all its utensils, and all the service connected with these, <span id="chapter3_verse37"></span><strong><sup>37 </sup></strong>as well as the pillars that were all around the courtyard and their socket pedestals, their tent pins, and their tent cords.</p>
<p id="p45" class="p45 sb"><span id="chapter3_verse38"></span><strong><sup>38 </sup></strong>Those camping in front of the tabernacle toward the east, before the tent of meeting toward the sunrise, were Moses and Aaron and his sons. They were responsible for taking care of the sanctuary as their obligation in behalf of the Israelites. Any unauthorized person<span id="footnotesource20"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote20">*</a> coming near would be put to death.</p>
<p id="p46" class="p46 sb"><span id="chapter3_verse39"></span><strong><sup>39 </sup></strong>All the Levite males from a month old and up, whom Moses and Aaron registered by their families at the order of Jehovah, were 22,000.</p>
<p id="p47" class="p47 sb"><span id="pos15579"></span><span id="chapter3_verse40"></span><strong><sup>40 </sup></strong>Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Register all the firstborn males of the Israelites from a month old and up, count them, and make a list of their names. <span id="chapter3_verse41"></span><strong><sup>41 </sup></strong>You must take the Levites for me—I am Jehovah—in place of all the firstborn of the Israelites, and take the domestic animals <span id="page220"></span>of the Levites in place of all the firstborn of the domestic animals of the Israelites.” <span id="chapter3_verse42"></span><strong><sup>42 </sup></strong>Moses then registered all the firstborn among the Israelites, just as Jehovah had commanded him. <span id="chapter3_verse43"></span><strong><sup>43 </sup></strong>The number of all the firstborn males who were registered by name from a month old and up was 22,273.</p>
<p id="p48" class="p48 sb"><span id="chapter3_verse44"></span><strong><sup>44 </sup></strong>Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying: <span id="chapter3_verse45"></span><strong><sup>45 </sup></strong>“Take the Levites in place of all the firstborn among the Israelites, and take the domestic animals of the Levites in place of their domestic animals, and the Levites must become mine.
