His mother’s name was Je·ru′shah the daughter of Za′dok. <span id="chapter27_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>He kept doing what was right in Jehovah’s eyes, just as his father Uz·zi′ah had done, except that he did not invade the temple of Jehovah. But the people were still acting ruinously. <span id="chapter27_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>He built the upper gate of Jehovah’s house, and he did much building on the wall of O′phel. <span id="chapter27_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>He also built cities in the mountainous region of Judah, and he built fortified places and towers in the wooded areas. <span id="chapter27_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>He waged war against the king of the Am′mon·ites and eventually prevailed against them, so that the Am′mon·ites gave him in that year 100 silver talents,<span id="footnotesource194"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote194">*</a> 10,000 cor measures<span id="footnotesource195"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote195">*</a> of wheat, and 10,000 of barley. The Am′mon·ites also paid this to him in the second and third years. <span id="chapter27_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>So Jo′tham kept growing strong, for he established<span id="footnotesource196"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote196">*</a> his ways before Jehovah his God.</p>
<p id="p160" class="p160 sb"><span id="chapter27_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>As for the rest of the history of Jo′tham, all his wars and his ways, it is written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and of Judah. <span id="chapter27_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>He was 25 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 16 years in Jerusalem. <span id="chapter27_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Then Jo′tham was laid to rest with his forefathers, and they buried him in the City of David. And his son A′haz became king in his place.</p>
