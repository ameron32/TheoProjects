<p id="p140" class="p140 sb"><span id="pos49558"></span><span id="chapter16"></span><span id="chapter16_verse1"></span><span class="w_ch"><strong>16 </strong></span>Now A′bram’s wife Sar′ai had borne him no children, but she had an Egyptian servant whose name was Ha′gar. <span id="chapter16_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>So Sar′ai said to A′bram: “Please now! Jehovah has prevented me from bearing children. Please, have relations with my servant. Perhaps I can have children by means of her.” So A′bram listened to what Sar′ai said. <span id="chapter16_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>After A′bram had lived for ten years in the land of Ca′naan, A′bram’s wife Sar′ai took her Egyptian servant Ha′gar and gave her to her husband A′bram as his wife. <span id="chapter16_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>So he had relations with Ha′gar, and she became pregnant. When she realized that she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress.</p>
<p id="p141" class="p141 sb"><span id="chapter16_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>At this Sar′ai said to A′bram: “The injury done to me is your fault. I was the one who put my servant in your arms,<span id="footnotesource111"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote111">*</a> but when she realized that she was pregnant, she began to despise me. May Jehovah judge between me and you.” <span id="chapter16_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>So A′bram said to Sar′ai: “Look! Your servant is under <span id="page60"></span>your authority. Do to her whatever you think is best.” Then Sar′ai humiliated her, and she ran away from her.</p>
<p id="p142" class="p142 sb"><span id="chapter16_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Later Jehovah’s angel found her at a spring of waters in the wilderness, the spring on the way to Shur. <span id="chapter16_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>And he said: “Ha′gar, servant of Sar′ai, where have you come from and where are you going?” To this she said: “I am running away from my mistress Sar′ai.” <span id="chapter16_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Jehovah’s angel then said to her: “Return to your mistress and humble yourself under her hand.” <span id="chapter16_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Then Jehovah’s angel said: “I will greatly multiply your offspring,<span id="footnotesource112"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote112">*</a> so that they will be too numerous to count.” <span id="chapter16_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Jehovah’s angel added: “Here you are pregnant, and you will give birth to a son, and you must name him Ish′ma·el,<span id="footnotesource113"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote113">*</a> for Jehovah has heard your affliction. <span id="chapter16_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>He will be a wild donkey<span id="footnotesource114"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote114">*</a> of a man. His hand will be against everyone, and everyone’s hand will be against him, and he will dwell opposite all his brothers.”<span id="footnotesource115"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote115">*</a></p>
<p id="p143" class="p143 sb"><span id="chapter16_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Then she called on the name of Jehovah, who was speaking to her: “You are a God of sight,” for she said: “Have I here actually looked upon the one who sees me?” <span id="chapter16_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>That is why the well was called Be′er-la′hai-roi.<span id="footnotesource116"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote116">*</a> (It is between Ka′desh and Be′red.) <span id="chapter16_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>So Ha′gar bore to A′bram a son, and A′bram named his son, whom Ha′gar bore, Ish′ma·el. <span id="chapter16_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>A′bram was 86 years old when Ha′gar bore Ish′ma·el to him.</p>
