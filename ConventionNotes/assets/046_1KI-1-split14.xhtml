<p id="p134" class="p134 sb"><span id="pos81063"></span><span id="chapter14"></span><span id="chapter14_verse1"></span><span class="w_ch"><strong>14 </strong></span>At that time A·bi′jah the son of Jer·o·bo′am fell sick. <span id="chapter14_verse2"></span><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>So Jer·o·bo′am said to his wife: “Rise up, please, and disguise yourself so that they will not know that you are Jer·o·bo′am’s wife, and go to Shi′loh. Look! A·hi′jah the prophet is there. He is the one who spoke of me becoming king over this people. <span id="chapter14_verse3"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Take with you ten loaves of bread, sprinkled cakes, and a flask of honey, and go to him. He will then tell you what is going to happen to the boy.”</p>
<p id="p135" class="p135 sb"><span id="chapter14_verse4"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Jer·o·bo′am’s wife did what he said. She rose up and went to Shi′loh and came to the house of A·hi′jah. A·hi′jah’s eyes stared straight ahead, and he could not see because of his age.</p>
<p id="p136" class="p136 sb"><span id="chapter14_verse5"></span><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>But Jehovah had told A·hi′jah: “Here is the wife of Jer·o·bo′am coming to inquire of you regarding her son, for he is sick. I will tell you what to say to her.<span id="footnotesource164"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote164">*</a> When she arrives, she will conceal her identity.”</p>
<p id="p137" class="p137 sb"><span id="chapter14_verse6"></span><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>As soon as A·hi′jah heard the sound of her footsteps as she was coming into the entrance, he said: “Come in, wife of Jer·o·bo′am. Why are you concealing your identity? I have been assigned to give you a harsh message. <span id="chapter14_verse7"></span><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Go, tell Jer·o·bo′am, ‘This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says: “I raised you up from among your people to make you a leader over my people Israel. <span id="chapter14_verse8"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Then I ripped the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you. But you have not become like my servant David, who kept my commandments and who walked after me with all his heart, doing only what was right in my eyes. <span id="chapter14_verse9"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>But you have done worse than all those who were prior to you, and you made for yourself another god and metal images<span id="footnotesource165"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote165">*</a> to offend me, and it is I whom you have turned your back on. <span id="chapter14_verse10"></span><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>For that reason I am bringing calamity on the house of Jer·o·bo′am, and I will annihilate<span id="footnotesource166"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote166">*</a> from Jer·o·bo′am every male,<span id="footnotesource167"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote167">*</a> including the helpless and weak in Israel, and I will make a clean sweep of the house of Jer·o·bo′am, just as one clears away the dung until it is all gone! <span id="chapter14_verse11"></span><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Anyone belonging to Jer·o·bo′am who dies in the city, the dogs will eat; and anyone who dies in the field, the birds of the heavens will eat, for Jehovah has spoken it.”’</p>
<p id="p138" class="p138 sb"><span id="chapter14_verse12"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>“Now rise up; go to your house. When you set foot in the city, the child will die. <span id="chapter14_verse13"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>All <span id="page507"></span>Israel will mourn him and bury him, for he alone of Jer·o·bo′am’s family will be laid in a grave, because he is the only one of the house of Jer·o·bo′am in whom Jehovah the God of Israel has found something good. <span id="chapter14_verse14"></span><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Jehovah will raise up for himself a king over Israel who will do away with<span id="footnotesource168"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote168">*</a> the house of Jer·o·bo′am from that day forward, yes, even now. <span id="chapter14_verse15"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Jehovah will strike Israel down like a reed that sways in the water, and he will uproot Israel off this good land that he gave to their forefathers, and he will scatter them beyond the River,<span id="footnotesource169"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote169">*</a> because they made their sacred poles,<span id="footnotesource170"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote170">*</a> offending Jehovah. <span id="chapter14_verse16"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>And he will abandon Israel because of the sins that Jer·o·bo′am has committed and has caused Israel to commit.”</p>
<p id="p139" class="p139 sb"><span id="chapter14_verse17"></span><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>At that Jer·o·bo′am’s wife rose up and went on her way and came to Tir′zah. As she came to the threshold of the house, the boy died. <span id="chapter14_verse18"></span><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>So they buried him, and all Israel mourned him, according to Jehovah’s word that he had spoken through his servant A·hi′jah the prophet.</p>
<p id="p140" class="p140 sb"><span id="chapter14_verse19"></span><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>And the rest of the history of Jer·o·bo′am, how he waged war and how he reigned, is written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Israel. <span id="chapter14_verse20"></span><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>And the length<span id="footnotesource171"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote171">*</a> of Jer·o·bo′am’s reign was 22 years, after which he was laid to rest with his forefathers; and his son Na′dab became king in his place.</p>
<p id="p141" class="p141 sb"><span id="pos84649"></span><span id="chapter14_verse21"></span><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>Meanwhile, Re·ho·bo′am the son of Sol′o·mon had become king in Judah. Re·ho·bo′am was 41 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 17 years in Jerusalem, the city that Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel as the place to put his name. The name of Re·ho·bo′am’s mother was Na′a·mah the Am′mon·it·ess. <span id="chapter14_verse22"></span><strong><sup>22 </sup></strong>And Judah was doing what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah, and by the sins they committed they provoked him more than their forefathers had done. <span id="chapter14_verse23"></span><strong><sup>23 </sup></strong>They too kept building for themselves high places, sacred pillars, and sacred poles<span id="footnotesource172"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote172">*</a> on every high hill and under every luxuriant tree. <span id="chapter14_verse24"></span><strong><sup>24 </sup></strong>There were also male temple prostitutes in the land. They acted according to all the detestable things of the nations that Jehovah had driven out before the Israelites.</p>
<p id="p142" class="p142 sb"><span id="pos85457"></span><span id="chapter14_verse25"></span><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>In the fifth year of King Re·ho·bo′am, King Shi′shak of Egypt came up against Jerusalem. <span id="chapter14_verse26"></span><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>He took the treasures of the house of Jehovah and the treasures of the king’s house.<span id="footnotesource173"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote173">*</a> He took everything, including all the gold shields that Sol′o·mon had made. <span id="chapter14_verse27"></span><strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>So King Re·ho·bo′am made copper shields to replace them, and he entrusted them to the chiefs of the guard,<span id="footnotesource174"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote174">*</a> who guarded the entrance of the king’s house. <span id="chapter14_verse28"></span><strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>Whenever the king came to the house of Jehovah, the guards would carry them, and then they would return them to the guard chamber.</p>
<p id="p143" class="p143 sb"><span id="chapter14_verse29"></span><strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>And the rest of the history of Re·ho·bo′am, all that he did, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah? <span id="chapter14_verse30"></span><strong><sup>30 </sup></strong>There was constant warfare between Re·ho·bo′am and Jer·o·bo′am. <span id="chapter14_verse31"></span><strong><sup>31 </sup></strong>Then Re·ho·bo′am was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried with his forefathers in the City of David. His mother’s name was Na′a·mah the <span id="page508"></span>Am′mon·it·ess. And his son A·bi′jam<span id="footnotesource175"></span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote175">*</a> became king in his place.</p>
